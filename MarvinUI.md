#### Config page - URL Replacers section

You have the possibility to replace the application resources with some generic aliases, in order to be able to address that page generically. For this, Marvin allows you to define replacer rules (regex or exact match) for application URLs.

`Eg: An URL in the application under test could be: `https://localhost:4200/articles/2423453254354356465` -> for the Article details page. We want to refer the Article details page for any article from the application. In this case we want to have something like this: `https://localhost:4200/articles/{articleId}`. `

#### Config page - Info Selectors section

You can extend the default info selectors that are configured in the source code. 

`Eg: span, p are not included in the default info selectors`

#### Config page - Action Selectors section

You can extend the default action selectors that are configured in the source code.

`Eg: .button is not included in the default action selectors.`

#### Config page - Iterators section

You have the possibility to define some rules to uniquely identify an item from a list/table. This iterator will allow you to perform actions (eg: delete, edit) on a specific item from the list, that satisfies some rules (eg: you want to delete an article from the list that has a specific tile, defined in `identifier` element of the iterator configuration)

#### Config page - Optimizer section

You have the possibility to change the default priority that is used to determine a unique locator for each element from the current page. The default order for defining a unique locator is: by tag, id, attribute, and by class.

Also, you have the possibility to exclude some tag/id/attribute/class, by defining a regex and/or an exact value.

#### Config page - Store section

You have the possibility to define run parameters (eg: username and password) for the application under test, to use them in the execution flows.

<img width="1790" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15820565/231105557-fa474fd9-7392-48ce-976b-ec9660e6666f.png">

### Workspace page

You have the possibility to define methods for each page from the application under test. You have the possibility to execute these methods with different parameters, across a partial flow or across a whole flow. At each step of the flow, all the elements from the current page are automatically discovered. A screenshot is performed after each step is finished.

#### Add a new step in the flow

Clicking on the '+' sign, a side panel is displayed where the user can create a new method or select an existing one.

 A. **Create new method**

Clicking on the 'Create a new method' button, a side panel is displayed where you can select all the needed elements.

<img width="1790" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15820565/215434519-c71274cc-b8cf-4c1e-ae21-16eec177135e.png">

 B. **Select an existing method**
 
Clicking on the 'Select method' dropdown a list of existing methods for the current page is displayed.

Selecting a method from the list, you will be able to define values for the method parameters (in case the selected method has 'fillAndClear' elements).

> ðŸš© **Note**
> After defining a method execution, a new step is inserted in the flow:

#### Execute a step from the graph

The corresponding branch will be executed up to the current step by clicking on the â€˜playâ€™ button for a step from the graph. The execution is highlighted:

#### View locators list

After running a step from the flow, the view locators list button is available. Clicking on it, the locator list is displayed.

<img width="1790" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15820565/231386690-5f4c5747-7196-424c-81a3-707000ce7a84.png">

The user can search for a specific locator in the list.

#### View screenshot

After running a step from the flow, the view screenshot button is available. Clicking on it, the screenshot is displayed.

<img width="1790" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15820565/231387994-9bd6c985-1833-4afe-add8-6356496042c9.png">

#### Delete a step from the flow

Clicking on 'Delete icon' for a step from the flow will remove that step execution from the tree.

<img width="1790" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15820565/231388348-80e29e44-a45e-45e0-9f03-9ac017701d75.png">

It deletes only the method execution. The method definition is still available in the list and can be used with different parameter values.

#### Move a step in the tree

The steps which are on the same level can be moved in the tree, by clicking on the â€˜Moveâ€™ icon.
In the tree click on the step that you want to move, then click on the â€˜Moveâ€™ icon in the upper menu. After this, the move icon is displayed also in the tree and it indicates to the user the allowed positions. Click on an allowed position in the tree and the step will be moved accordingly.

#### Focus on a specific part from the tree

In case the tree is getting too long, the user can focus on a specific part, by clicking on the â€˜focusâ€™ icon for the desired step from the tree. In this way, the selected step (with its children if this is the case) from the tree is displayed in the focus area at the bottom of the left side panel. 
By default, the whole tree is displayed in the focus area.
